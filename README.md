# End-to-End DevOps CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins, Ansible & Kubernetes

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an end-to-end DevOps CI/CD pipeline
to automate the build, containerization, and deployment of a Java-based web application.

The primary goal of this project is to eliminate manual deployment steps and
understand how different DevOps tools work together in a real-world CI/CD workflow.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional application deployments involve manual steps such as building the code,
copying artifacts, and deploying applications on servers. These manual processes are:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Difficult to scale and manage

This project solves the problem by automating the entire deployment lifecycle using
DevOps tools and YAML-based configurations.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Git & GitHub** – Source code management
- **Jenkins** – Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Maven** – Build automation tool
- **Docker** – Application containerization
- **Docker Hub** – Docker image repository
- **Ansible** – Deployment automation
- **Kubernetes** – Container orchestration
- **Linux** – Server environment

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow
The complete CI/CD flow implemented in this project is as follows:

1. Developer pushes source code to GitHub.
2. Jenkins automatically pulls the latest code from GitHub.
3. Maven builds the application and generates a WAR file.
4. Docker image is created using the WAR file.
5. Ansible playbooks automate Docker image build and push to Docker Hub.
6. Kubernetes pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub.
7. Application is deployed as pods using Kubernetes Deployment.
8. Kubernetes Service (LoadBalancer) exposes the application to users.

## 🐳 Docker Implementation
- Dockerfile is used to package the Java application along with Tomcat.
- WAR file generated by Maven is copied into the Docker image.
- Docker images are versioned and pushed to Docker Hub for reuse.

---

## ⚙️ Jenkins Automation
- Jenkins is configured to automatically trigger builds on GitHub code changes.
- It runs Maven commands to build the application.
- Jenkins invokes Ansible playbooks to automate deployment tasks.

---

## 🤖 Ansible Automation
- Ansible playbooks are used to:
  - Build Docker images
  - Push Docker images to Docker Hub
- This avoids manual SSH access to servers and ensures repeatable deployments.

---

## ☸️ Kubernetes Deployment
- Kubernetes Deployment YAML defines:
  - Number of replicas (pods)
  - Docker image to run
- Kubernetes Service YAML exposes the application using a LoadBalancer.
- Multiple pods ensure scalability and reliability.

---

## ✅ Key Features
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- Containerized application deployment
- Infrastructure-independent deployments
- YAML-based configuration for easy management
- Scalable application deployment using Kubernetes

---

## 📈 Outcomes & Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with real-world CI/CD workflows
- Understood integration between Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, and Kubernetes
- Learned how containerized applications are deployed and managed
- Improved understanding of automation and DevOps best practices
